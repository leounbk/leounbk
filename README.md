I'm new to programming and I'm currently learning Python.
Don't expect anything complex here, at least for some time..
Feedbacks are welcome. 🐈‍⬛

I learned English by myself when I was a kid by playing some Roleplay games on BYOND.. So I kind of had to learn to understand stuff lol.
I'm studying Japanese at the moment as a hobby, and I like watching random videos about random stuff on YouTube, 
so I can learn a bit more about different things happening around the world.
That's it about me, see you around. :)
